//  Completed!
//  You are in charge of the cake for your niece's birthday and have decided
//  the cake will have one candle for each year of her total age.
//  When she blows out the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones.
//  Your task is to find out how many candles she can successfully blow out.
//  For example, if your niece is turning 5 years old, and the cake will have 5 candles of height 6, 6, 2, 1, 6,
//  she will be able to blow out 3 candles successfully,
//  since the tallest candles are of height 6 and there are 3 such candles.
//  Please Complete the function birthdayCakeCandles in the exercise 1_6_todo.
//  It must return an integer representing the number of candles she can blow out.
